# STLtoOpenFOAM
This repository contains a Python script for analyzing STL geometry files using VTK. The script computes various geometric properties such as volume, surface area, curvature, and more. It also identifies points inside and outside the geometry and generates a blockMeshDict for OpenFOAM.
